# MedCureAI: AI-Based X-ray & Symptom Classification System

- MedCureAI is an AI-based system designed to assist in the classification of X-ray images and symptoms for medical diagnosis. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for X-ray image classification and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for symptom classification. The system is built using TensorFlow, Keras, Flask, and the Google Gemini API to provide a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals.

## Features
- X-ray Classification: Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify X-ray images into various medical conditions.
- Symptom Classification: Uses LSTM to classify and predict possible medical conditions based on symptoms input by the user.
- Web Interface: Developed with Flask to provide a simple web interface where users can upload X-ray images and input symptoms for analysis.
